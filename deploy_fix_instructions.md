# Python-Magic Deployment Fix

## Problem
The deployment is failing with: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'magic'`

## Solution
Add the following line to `requirements.txt`:

```
python-magic==0.4.27
```

## Current Requirements.txt Should Include:
```
Flask==3.0.3
Flask-Cors==4.0.1
Flask-Bcrypt==1.0.1
psycopg2-binary==2.9.10
python-dotenv==1.0.1
PyJWT==2.8.0
gunicorn==22.0.0
pytest==8.2.2
requests==2.32.3
beautifulsoup4==4.12.3
# Security-focused packages
cryptography==42.0.8
Werkzeug==3.0.3
# Standard web development packages
python-dateutil==2.8.2
Jinja2==3.1.2
# Image generation packages
Pillow==10.4.0
# File security and validation
python-magic==0.4.27
```

## Manual Steps (if git push continues to timeout):
1. Go to GitHub repository: https://github.com/bricks4tricks/LogicAndStories
2. Edit `requirements.txt` directly in web interface
3. Add `python-magic==0.4.27` to the end of the file
4. Commit with message: "Add python-magic dependency for file security"
5. Trigger new deployment via webhook: `curl -X POST "https://api.render.com/deploy/srv-d24jc9je5dus73dbobdg?key=RqBLDW_sqd4"`

## Local Fix Status
✅ Local requirements.txt already contains python-magic==0.4.27
✅ Fix is committed locally in commit edae023
❌ Git push operations are timing out
